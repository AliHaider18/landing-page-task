# Ropstam Landing Page

This project is a test task developed for Ropstam. It is a landing page built using React, Vite, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The project features several reusable components to create a modern, responsive design.

## Features

- **React & TypeScript:** Efficient development with type safety.
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling.
- **Reusable Components:** Modular components for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Vite:** Fast development server with hot module replacement (HMR).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If the above command doesn't work, try using the following command to resolve legacy dependency issues:

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   Start the development server using:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start Vite's dev server, and you can view the landing page by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

4. **Build the project for production:**

   To create an optimized production build, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview the production build:**

   After building the project, you can preview the production build locally using:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

6. **Recommended Node.js version:**

   It is recommended to use Node.js version 20 for this project to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
